          Richard Feynman, one of the most famous physicists of the 20th
          century, died on February 15, 1988, at the age of 69. Feynman was a
          Nobel Prize-winning physicist who made significant contributions to
          the fields of quantum mechanics, particle physics, and the theory of
          quantum electrodynamics. <br />

          Feynman's death was caused by two rare forms of cancer:
          Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, a type of lymphoma, and
          liposarcoma, a type of soft-tissue cancer. He had been diagnosed
          with the lymphoma in 1978, and underwent treatment that was
          initially successful in putting the disease in remission. However,
          the cancer returned in 1986, and he was subsequently diagnosed with
          the liposarcoma as well. <br />
          <br />
          Feynman continued to work throughout his illness, and even gave a
          series of lectures at the California Institute of Technology
          (Caltech) in the months leading up to his death. He also wrote a
          memoir, "What Do You Care What Other People Think?" which was
          published posthumously. <br />
          <br />
          "What Do You Care What Other People Think?" is a collection of
          personal stories and reflections on his life and work. The book is
          divided into two parts: the first part, "The Making of a Scientist,"
          focuses on Feynman's early life and education, while the second
          part, "The Challenger," is about Feynman's role in the investigation
          into the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. <br />
          The book includes anecdotes from Feynman's life, such as his
          experiences learning to play the bongos and his travels to Brazil,
          as well as his thoughts on topics such as the role of science in
          society and the importance of curiosity and skepticism. <br /><br />
          In "The Challenger" section of the book, Feynman describes his work
          on the commission investigating the explosion of the Challenger, and
          his efforts to understand the technical and organizational failures
          that led to the disaster. He also discusses his frustration with the
          bureaucratic and political obstacles he faced during the
          investigation. <br />
          <br />

          Feynman's death was widely mourned in the scientific community, as
          well as by the general public. He was known not only for his
          groundbreaking scientific contributions, but also for his engaging
          personality and ability to explain complex scientific concepts in
          simple terms. His legacy continues to inspire scientists and
          students around the world. <br />
